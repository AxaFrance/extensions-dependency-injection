# How to Contribute

## Reporting Issues [WIP]

Should you run into issues with the project, please don't hesitate to let us know by
[filing an issue](https://github.com/axa-group/[PROJECT_NAME]/issues/new).

Pull requests containing only failing tests demonstrating the issue are welcomed
and this also helps ensure that your issue won't regress in the future once it's fixed.

## Pull Requests

We accept pull requests!

Generally we like to see pull requests that:

- Build
- Maintain the [existing code style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
- Are focused on a single change (i.e. avoid large refactoring or style adjustments in untouched code if not the primary goal of the pull request)
- Have good commit messages. We use the [angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
- Have tests
- Don't decrease the current code coverage

If you add a new feature, make sure it is tested, and documented:
- In the code samples
- In the [README.md](./README.md)

We use [GithubFlow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to manage our branches.
